# PrivateAgent

PrivateAgent is an open-source Android automation agent built with Flutter. It utilizes the DeepSeek API and native Android Accessibility Services to interpret screen layouts and execute multi-step tasks across any installed application via natural language commands.

## Architecture

The system operates on a continuous feedback loop:
1. The user issues a command (via voice, text, or Telegram remote access).
2. The agent captures the current screen hierarchy, calculating the exact spatial coordinates of all interactive elements.
3. The layout data is transmitted to the AI provider alongside the current task context and the result of the previous action.
4. The AI determines the next optimal action (e.g., clicking specific coordinates, inputting text, scrolling).
5. The native Android layer executes the action.
6. The loop repeats until the task is marked as complete.

## Capabilities

- **Screen Reading:** Parses the Android UI tree to map clickable, scrollable, and editable elements.
- **Coordinate-Based Interaction:** Simulates physical screen taps based on coordinate geometry, mitigating issues with missing text labels or inaccessible icons.
- **Remote Access:** Integrates with the Telegram Bot API via background polling, allowing users to issue commands and monitor task execution progress remotely.
- **Voice Control:** Native speech-to-text integration for hands-free operation.
